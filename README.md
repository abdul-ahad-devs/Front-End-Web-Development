# Front-End-Web-Development
I used following techonologies to make this project:

html5, 
CSS3, 
BootStrap,
JavaScript

For making the webpages responsive, I used many BootStrap classes.
The forms which I used are called BootStrap Shadow Forms (the whole theme displays a shadow-theme)
For HD pictures (background and wallpapers) and logos, I used online internet resources.
